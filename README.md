# Cyber Security Portfolio
This is my cyber security learning journey — (TryHackMe write-ups, projects, tools, and skills)

##  About Me:
I'm Esa, an aspiring cyber security professional interested in ethical hacking, blue team analysis, and real-world security skills.  
I'm building experience through labs, VM environments, and hands-on practice.

## 🧠 Skills I'm Developing:
- **Linux:** navigation, permissions, file discovery  
- **Networking:** ports, protocols, scanning fundamentals  
- **Web Security:** OWASP Top 10 basics  
- **Scripting:** beginner Python  
- **Incident Detection:** SIEM and log analysis  
- **Security Tools:** Nmap, Gobuster, dirb, Burp Suite, Splunk  


## 🧰 Tools I've Used:
- Linux CLI  
- Nmap  
- Gobuster / dirb  
- Burp Suite (basic)  
- Splunk SIEM  
- Python  
- Web fuzzing tools  

## 🎄 TryHackMe — Advent of Cyber 2025 Progress:
Short summaries and write-ups for each room will go into the `/tryhackme/aoc-2025/` folder.
- **Warm-Up: Prep Track** → `tryhackme/aoc-2025/warmup.md`  
- **Linux CLI — Shells Bells** → `tryhackme/aoc-2025/linux-shells-bells.md`  
- **Phishing — Merry Clickmas** → `tryhackme/aoc-2025/phishing.md`  
- **Splunk Basics — Did You SIEM?** → `tryhackme/aoc-2025/splunk-basics.md`  

 I will add more rooms as I complete them.
 
## Cyber Security Projects:
Each project will have its own folder under `/projects/`.

### • Password Strength Checker (Python):
A small script that evaluates password complexity and gives a strength rating.

### • Internal Cyber Lab (Kali + Windows VM):
Setting up a home lab to practise scanning, enumeration, and testing.

### • Nmap Scan Analysis:
Running an Nmap scan against a VM and analysing open ports, services, and risks.

##  Repository Structure (Planned)
